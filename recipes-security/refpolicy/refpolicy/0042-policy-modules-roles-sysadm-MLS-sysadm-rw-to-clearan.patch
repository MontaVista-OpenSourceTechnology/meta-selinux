Subject: [PATCH] policy/modules/roles/sysadm: MLS - sysadm rw to clearance

The two new rules make sysadm_t domain MLS trusted for:
 - reading from files at all levels.
 - writing to processes up to its clearance(s0-s15).

With default MLS policy, root user would login as sysadm_t:s0 by
default. Most processes will run in sysadm_t:s0 because no
domtrans/rangetrans rules, as a result, even root could not access
high level files/processes.

So with the two new rules, root user could work easier in MLS policy.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [embedded specific]
